## General Information
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The best fitted line explaining the model is represented by 
 cnt = 35.431 + 22.477 * yr + 13.622 * casual - 17.435 * Spring - 6.360 * Cloudy - 8.474 *Rain

- The above model shows that year is an important factor impacting the number of bikes rented. In comparsion to 2018, it is observed that number of bikes rented in 2019 has certainly increased. It looks like the trend will be maintained. 
- The casual users plays in important factor in contributing to total numbers. It is recommended to encourage these casual users to be converted to registered users. May be company can attract them through some offers like a referral bonus. 
- In case of weather being Cloudy or Rain, people would not prefer to ride by bikes. 
- In the spring season, tthe numbers shows people prefer bikes to communte. However, model suggest that it is negatively affecting the numbers, which needs further investogation.
